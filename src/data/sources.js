    type: "Bear Thesis",
    color: "#E63946",
    format: "Future-dated post-mortem (written as if from June 2028)",
    keyThesis: "AI makes human intelligence abundant → white-collar displacement → consumption collapse → financial contagion → policy failure. Economy's institutions built for scarce human intelligence. Repricing is painful, disorderly, and investable.",
    chapters: [
      "SaaS Compression: In-house AI becomes credible BATNA → 30% renewal discounts → ServiceNow cuts 15% workforce",
      "Friction Collapse: AI agents destroy habitual intermediation (DoorDash, travel, insurance) → stablecoins route around card interchange",
      "White-Collar Displacement: JOLTS professional services openings collapse → top 20% earners drive 65% spending → 2% job loss = 3-4% discretionary hit",
      "Ghost GDP: Productivity up, wages down → M2 velocity flatlines → labor share drops from 56% to 46%",
      "Financial Contagion: $2.5T private credit defaults → PE-insurance daisy chain (Apollo/Athene) → prime mortgages threatened",
      "Policy Trap: Government needs to transfer more while collecting less → traditional tools can't address structural cause",
    ],
    ourAssessment: "Direction plausible, speed compressed (5-8 years into 2). Underweights institutional drag, legal friction, deployment difficulty. 45% probability of 'Slow Grind' variant.",
    strengthsWeaknesses: {
      strengths: ["Strongest on financial contagion mechanics (PE-insurance-mortgage chain)", "Best articulation of 'Ghost GDP' concept", "Compelling on SaaS negotiation dynamics (BATNA framework)", "Gets the reflexive loop right: displacement → less spending → more displacement"],
      weaknesses: ["Timeline too compressed — institutional friction slows everything", "Mortgage crisis scenario requires faster income decline than plausible", "Underweights government response capacity (see: COVID stimulus speed)", "Assumes AI deployment is frictionless — ignores integration, trust, regulation"],

    type: "Capability Thesis",
    color: "#E9C46A",
    format: "165-page essay series (5 chapters + introduction)",
    keyThesis: "AGI by 2027 is strikingly plausible. GPT-2 to GPT-4 = preschooler to smart high-schooler in 4 years. Extrapolating compute + algorithmic efficiency trendlines = another equivalent jump by 2027. Then intelligence explosion → superintelligence. This triggers the most consequential geopolitical race in history.",
    chapters: [
      "From GPT-4 to AGI: Counting the OOMs — ~0.5 OOMs/year compute + ~0.5 OOMs/year algorithmic efficiency + 'unhobbling' gains = AGI-level by 2027",
      "From AGI to Superintelligence: The Intelligence Explosion — Hundreds of millions of AGIs automate AI research → decade of progress compressed into ≤1 year",
      "The Challenges: IQ ≠ Reliability, 'unhobbling' still needed, but trendlines are relentless",
      "The Project: US government will inevitably nationalize/control AGI development → wartime-style mobilization",
      "Security & Geopolitics: China espionage threat is existential → current lab security is catastrophically inadequate",
    ],
    ourAssessment: "Capability trajectory largely validated by events since publication (Claude 3.5 → 4, o1/o3, Gemini 2.0). Timeline aggressive but defensible. Weaker on economic/social consequences — focuses on capability, not distribution.",
    strengthsWeaknesses: {
      strengths: ["Most rigorous capability extrapolation available", "Written by someone who was inside OpenAI — not speculating from outside", "OOMs framework gives falsifiable predictions", "Geopolitical analysis is sobering and underappreciated", "Now manages $1.5B fund — has skin in the game"],
      weaknesses: ["Almost entirely focused on capability, not economic/social distribution", "Assumes smooth scaling — doesn't account for potential plateaus (which have partially materialized)", "Geopolitical framing is US-centric and somewhat hawkish", "Doesn't address the 'who benefits?' question that Citrini tackles", "Written June 2024 — some predictions testable now"],

    type: "Bull Rebuttal",
    color: "#2A9D8F",
    format: "Companion piece — same premise, same framework, opposite conclusion",
    keyThesis: "Same AI disruption happens, but the economy adapts faster than bears expect. Displaced workers + cheap AI tools = explosion of new business formation. Cost of starting a business falls 70-80%. Labor market doesn't stabilize because old jobs return — it stabilizes because new jobs that didn't have titles yet get created.",
    chapters: [
      "SaaS repricing is real but not economic collapse — $500B bloated spend gets rationalized, spending redirects",
      "White-collar displacement is real but transitional (9 months, not 9 years) — recovery by Q3 2027",
      "New business formation explodes — 'minimum viable ambition' drops to near zero with AI tools",
      "Housing crisis doesn't materialize — incomes shift from corporate to entrepreneurial but recover in aggregate",
      "The 'AI-assisted' prefix: every professional services category gets augmented, not eliminated",
    ],
    ourAssessment: "This is essentially our 'New Guilds' variant (20% probability) + 'Bifurcation' variant (20%). Compelling counter-argument. The truth likely lives between Citrini's bear case and this bull case.",
    strengthsWeaknesses: {
      strengths: ["Directly addresses Citrini's weakest assumptions (permanent displacement, no adaptation)", "Historical precedent is on the bull side — economies do adapt", "The 'cost of starting a business falls 70-80%' observation is already happening", "Gets the Lucid Box thesis right — this is YOUR opportunity landscape"],
      weaknesses: ["Assumes adaptation happens smoothly and quickly — could be messier", "Doesn't address the financial contagion chain (Citrini's strongest argument)", "May underweight the speed of displacement vs. speed of adaptation", "Survivorship bias — focuses on success stories, not those who don't adapt"],

    type: "Trade Expression",
    color: "#6D6875",
    format: "Macro analysis + bond trade thesis",
    keyThesis: "If abundant intelligence compresses earning power faster than politics can rebuild stability → demand fragility → growth scares → duration becomes convex. Long end of the yield curve is where the trade lives.",
    chapters: [
      "Citrini's mechanism is explicit: intelligence cheaper → fewer workers → earnings compress → spending slows → loop tightens",
      "Present tense still looks deceptively ordinary — that's where macro pressure builds quietly",
      "Bond market as expression: demand fragility pulls forward growth scares, duration becomes convex",
    ],
    ourAssessment: "Useful for understanding how the thesis maps to actual tradeable instruments. Less relevant for our equity-focused portfolio but worth tracking for macro signals.",
    strengthsWeaknesses: {
      strengths: ["Best translation of thesis into actual trade mechanics", "Identifies the yield curve as the real-time signal of thesis validation"],
      weaknesses: ["Bond-focused — less applicable to our equity/crypto portfolio", "Assumes rates market will price displacement before equity market does"],
