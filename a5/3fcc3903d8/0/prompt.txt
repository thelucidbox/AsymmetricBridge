I want to focus on polishing up AsymmetricBridge. I had Gemini review the website and they gave me some suggestions and then I had Claude on the web review Gemini suggestions I'm gonna give those to you both but what I would love for you to do is to review everything and it's entirely and every review the site and the project and it's entirety, and I want you to think of three novel and innovative additions that we could make to it that would serve my purposes. One thing I would love to do is to have a place where we might have the opportunity to uploadour brokerage information with regards to the pics that the stocks that we might be investing in based on this thesis for a quick analysis, maybe quarter over quarter something like that. Anyway, here is the information first I'll give you Gemini to review and then after that you'll get Claude's review of Gemini's review.:Seriously analysis can you review the analysis and let me know what you think and really help me understand in the deep way:
This is an incredibly fascinating artifact. It is essentially a Bloomberg Terminal for a single human’s career and intellectual capital. I've reviewed all three videos and consolidated my observations.
Here is the deep-dive analysis of the "Asymmetric Bridge" platform, followed by 3 substantive ways to push this from a highly competent dashboard into a truly novel system.
PART 1: WHAT IS THIS THING?
 * What it is: This site is a unified personal operating system, macro-economic signal tracker, and commercial product launchpad. It cross-references AI capability advancements and economic shifts to trigger personal career moves, stock trades, and consulting product sales.
 * Problem it solves: It solves the problem of strategic paralysis during a technological paradigm shift. It translates abstract macro anxieties (e.g., "AI is going to kill SaaS") into specific, actionable local decisions.
 * Core Value Proposition: Actionable foresight. The user walks away with a mathematically grounded rationale for what to build, what to sell, and where to work next.
 * What it is practically: It is a hybrid: a functional private tool for the creator, while simultaneously serving as an ultra-high-end public portfolio piece demonstrating extreme competence to potential employers or clients.
 * Job to be done: "Alert me the exact moment the legacy software market begins to structurally fail, so I can short its stock, pivot my career to an AI lab, and sell adaptation consulting to the displaced workers."
PART 2: WHO IS IT FOR?
 * Primary Audience: The creator themselves. It acts as their command center to manage their financial and professional transitions.
 * Secondary Audience (The "Real" Target): Hiring managers at top-tier AI Labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind) and potential enterprise clients. It is built to be "found" or shared as proof of ability.
 * Assumptions: The site assumes a high baseline intelligence and deep familiarity with financial markets (NRR, long vol, default rates), macroeconomic theory (velocity of money), and AI development timelines.
 * Personalization: It is hyper-personalized to one specific individual—an enterprise software salesperson at Intuit ("managing 50-70 accounts") who is actively transitioning into AI building and consulting.
PART 3: THE NARRATIVE & ARGUMENT
 * The Flow: The site tells a relentless, logical story: AI is a macro shock (Thesis) \rightarrow This will collapse traditional SaaS margins and displace white-collar workers (Signals) \rightarrow I must position my financial portfolio to survive this (Portfolio) \rightarrow I will get a job at the companies causing the disruption (AI Jobs) \rightarrow I will build and sell tools to help everyone else adapt (Products).
 * The Argument: The central thesis is that "capability buildout is real regardless of bear/bull outcome," and the legacy SaaS business model is dead. Therefore, the only safe harbor is working at the AI labs or building the infrastructure for the "New Guilds".
 * Aha Moment: The "Position Connection" table under the portfolio section. Seeing a macroeconomic signal (e.g., "SaaS NRR < 110%") directly map to a financial trade ("Confirms short SaaS leg") and a product launch is a brilliant synthesis.
 * Emotional Response: It triggers a mix of validation, controlled paranoia, and urgency. It feels incredibly confident. It succeeds wildly in making the creator look like a strategic mastermind.
PART 4: CONTENT & DATA
 * Text/Labels: "Asymmetric Bridge," "Lucid Box," "Signal Tracker," "Thesis & Portfolio," "AI Jobs," "Domino Cascade".
 * Product Ladder: Ranges from a $0 "Content Engine" to a "1.5K\rightarrow$3K Claude Code Power Day," up to "$8-15K Team AI Enablement".
 * Signal Tracker Metrics: 24 total signals (9 auto-evaluated, 15 manual). Threat Level: ELEVATED. Tracks 5 "Dominos": 1. SaaS Compression, 2. White-Collar Displacement, 3. Friction Collapse, 4. Ghost GDP, 5. Financial Contagion.
 * Specific Signals: "Indeed SaaS Sales Job Postings," "Y Combinator 'Replace X' Startups," "Visa/Mastercard Purchase Volume Growth," "Deficit Trajectory".
 * Stock Tickers & Positions: Long AI (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN), Short SaaS (SNOW, NOW, CRM, ZS), Watch Alt Managers (BX, APO, KKR), Hedge (GLD, TLT, VIX calls).
 * Source Materials: Citrini Research ("Bear Thesis"), Leopold Aschenbrenner ("Capability Thesis"), Michael X. Bloch ("Bull Rebuttal"), Arya Deniz ("Trade Expression").
 * Target Employers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, xAI, Cohere.
PART 5: FUNCTIONALITY & INTERACTION
 * Interactions: Primarily tab-based navigation, expanding accordions for deep-dive reading, and standard web links.
 * User Input: As a viewer, it is static. However, it outlines a backend system for the owner to update manual signals via a "Update Signal Tab," prompting for inputs like "pick the signal \rightarrow set green/amber/red \rightarrow write what you found \rightarrow submit".
 * Data Integration: It notes that 9 signals auto-evaluate by fetching live data from FRED, Stocks, and Crypto APIs.
 * Call to Action: For the external viewer, the subtle CTA is to hire the creator or buy their products (buttons like "LAUNCH NOW" or "Careers \rightarrow").
PART 6: DESIGN & STRUCTURE
 * Aesthetic: "Terminal Chic." It mimics a Bloomberg terminal or developer IDE. Dark background, heavily structured tables, stark typography, and semantic coloring (red/green/yellow for data states).
 * Structure: Exceptionally organized. It relies heavily on dashboards, matrices, and cascading lists to handle dense information without overwhelming the user.
 * Vibe: Highly analytical, serious, and zero-fluff. It communicates "I am a rigorous thinker."
PART 7: WHAT’S WORKING & WHAT’S NOT
 * Working: The synthesis is masterful. Bringing together Leopold Aschenbrenner's capability thesis with granular stock market trades and a personal career pivot plan is unique and highly effective.
 * Falling Short: The manual upkeep. With 15 manual signals requiring monthly or quarterly reviews of earnings calls and congressional hearings, this system is brittle and relies on the creator having endless free time.
 * The Biggest Gap: It stops at observation. The site tells the creator exactly what the world is doing, but it doesn't execute the reaction automatically.
 * Most Novel Element: The "Domino Cascade." Visualizing macroeconomic collapse as a 5-step sequential process and tracking the exact data points that trigger each phase is a brilliant framing device.
PART 8: 3 GENUINE INNOVATIONS
Based on what this site has already achieved, here are three ways to push it from a great dashboard into a completely new paradigm for a career/business operating system.
1. The "Signal-to-Action" Auto-Execution Agent
 * What it is: Currently, if a signal flashes red (e.g., "SaaS NRR drops below 110%"), the creator reads it and decides what to do. This innovation hooks those signals directly into external APIs to execute actions automatically. If Domino 1 (SaaS Compression) tips into the red, the site automatically executes API calls to:
   * Dynamically increase the price of the "Claude Code Power Day" product from $1.5K to $3K on the payment processor (pricing elasticity based on market panic).
   * Deploy a pre-written, targeted Twitter thread analyzing the SaaS collapse.
   * Trigger an automated cold email sequence to Anthropic and OpenAI recruiters pointing out the fresh data and reiterating the creator's value.
 * Why it matters: It closes the gap between insight and execution. It turns the platform from a "dashboard" into an autonomous career agent that trades on market volatility faster than humanly possible.
 * Why this site can do it: The site already has the logic mapped out perfectly (Signal \rightarrow Position Connection). It just needs the programmatic wiring to make the reaction autonomous.
2. Reverse-Engineered "Displacement" Simulator (Targeted Client Acquisition)
 * What it is: The site has deep data on exactly how and why SaaS margins are collapsing and which jobs are being displaced. By integrating a basic company data API (like Clearbit or LinkedIn), a user could type in a target company's name (e.g., "Salesforce" or "HubSpot"). The site then runs that company's public tech stack and employee distribution through the "Citrini/Leopold" thesis model. It outputs a predictive timeline of exactly which departments within that specific company will face friction collapse first, and generates a hyper-targeted pitch deck offering the "$8-15K Team AI Enablement" product.
 * Why it matters: It turns macro-theory into a hyper-personalized B2B sales weapon. Instead of just knowing "the market is shifting," the creator can say to a prospect, "Based on my tracking, your mid-market SDR team will become a negative margin center in exactly 4 months. Let's rebuild your workflows now."
 * Why this site can do it: The intellectual heavy lifting—understanding the transmission mechanisms of AI displacement—is already done and documented in the "Source Materials" section. This just points that weapon outward.
3. The Career "Net Asset Value" (NAV) Ticker
 * What it is: Treat the creator's skills exactly like the stock portfolio. Create a real-time "NAV" of their professional market value. As new AI capabilities are released (tracked via GitHub or AI Lab announcements), the system mathematically depreciates the value of legacy skills (e.g., "Enterprise Sales at Intuit" drops 5% in value because AI agents are handling procurement) and appreciates the value of new skills ("Built ALOS + Asymmetric Bridge" rises 10%).
 * Why it matters: It introduces a completely new paradigm for how humans view their careers. We currently view resumes as static lists. This would frame a professional skillset as a dynamic, tradable asset class that is constantly subjected to market forces. It would visually force the creator (or any user) to continuously acquire new skills just to prevent their career market cap from sliding to zero.
 * Why this site can do it: The creator is already comfortable blending financial market mechanics (long vol, contagion) with career positioning. Applying stock-market logic to human capital is the logical endpoint of their exact philosophy.
Would you like me to brainstorm how you might begin technically implementing one of these innovations (like mapping the auto-execution logic)? and now Claude's review of Gemini's insights: This is a strong analysis. But let me give you what you actually need — what the analysis *got right*, where it's flattering you instead of being honest, and whether those 3 innovations are genuinely novel or just dressed-up feature requests.

**What the analysis nails:**

The "Bloomberg Terminal for a single human's career" framing is exactly right. That's the pitch line. The narrative flow mapping (Thesis → Signals → Portfolio → Jobs → Products) is accurate and the analyst correctly identified that the *synthesis* is the differentiator — not any individual piece. Plenty of people track macro signals. Plenty of people have career plans. Nobody wires them together with explicit causal logic and trigger conditions. The "Position Connection" table linking a macro data point to a specific trade AND a product launch timing decision is genuinely novel. The analyst was right to flag that as the aha moment.

The "Domino Cascade" framing is also correctly identified as the most intellectually interesting structure. Treating economic disruption as a sequential, trackable chain reaction rather than a vague "things are changing" narrative — that's the kind of thinking that would make a hiring manager at Anthropic stop scrolling.

**Where the analysis is being generous rather than honest:**

The "strategic mastermind" language should make you pause. Here's the real tension: the site is trying to serve two masters and the analysis glosses over this. It's simultaneously a *private operational tool* (your command center) and a *public portfolio piece* (proof of competence). Those have fundamentally different design requirements. A private tool optimizes for information density and speed — you already know the context. A public portfolio piece needs to *teach* the viewer the framework before showing them the data. Right now, from the analyst's own description, the site assumes "deep familiarity with financial markets, macroeconomic theory, and AI development timelines." That means most hiring managers at your target companies would bounce off it. The people who would be most impressed are the people who least need convincing.

Think of it in your sales terms — it's like building a demo that only works for prospects who already bought. The signal-to-noise ratio is tuned for you, not for the audience you want to reach.

The analyst also identified the brittleness problem (15 manual signals) but understated how fatal that is. A dashboard that goes stale is worse than no dashboard — it signals the opposite of what you want. If someone visits and sees a signal last updated 6 weeks ago, the entire "rigorous thinker" brand collapses instantly.

**Now, the 3 innovations — honest assessment:**

**Innovation 1 (Signal-to-Action Auto-Execution Agent):** This sounds impressive but it's actually the weakest idea. Here's why — it's an engineering project disguised as a strategic innovation. Auto-posting tweets and sending recruiter emails when a signal trips isn't novel, it's Zapier with a macro thesis. More importantly, it's *dangerous*. Auto-executing cold outreach to Anthropic recruiters based on a signal threshold is the kind of thing that sounds brilliant in theory and gets you filtered as spam in practice. The value of the Asymmetric Bridge is the *judgment layer* — you interpreting signals and making moves. Automating that away removes the thing that makes you valuable. This idea confuses "faster" with "better."

**Innovation 2 (Displacement Simulator):** This is the strongest idea by far, and the analyst buried the lede on *why*. It's not just a "B2B sales weapon" — it's a fundamentally different product category. Right now, the site answers "what's happening in the macro environment?" The simulator would answer "what's about to happen to *your specific company*?" That's the difference between a weather report and a flood warning for your house. The analyst correctly identified that the intellectual framework already exists in your source materials. But the real innovation isn't the simulator itself — it's that it turns your *thesis* into a *service*. Your macro analysis becomes the engine behind personalized consulting deliverables. That's how you'd actually sell the $8-15K engagements — not with a generic pitch but with "here's what my model says about YOUR org."

**Innovation 3 (Career NAV Ticker):** This is the most *conceptually* interesting idea but the analyst didn't push hard enough on whether it's real or just a metaphor. The question is: what data would you actually feed this? Stock prices have a market generating continuous price discovery. There's no equivalent labor market mechanism giving you real-time skill valuations. You'd essentially be making up the depreciation/appreciation curves, which means it's an *opinion engine* wearing quantitative clothing. That said — if you leaned into this honestly (making explicit that these are model-driven estimates, not market prices), it becomes something genuinely new. Nobody has built a tool that says "your enterprise sales skills depreciated 12% this quarter because of these 3 AI agent launches." Even as an estimate, that reframing would be psychologically powerful.

**The open-source question you originally asked:**

This is where it gets really interesting. If you opened this up so anyone could input their own career data and run it against your macro framework, you'd be building something that doesn't exist — a **personal career hedge fund model**. The value isn't the dashboard. The value is the *thesis engine* underneath it. The Domino Cascade framework, the signal-to-position mapping logic, the displacement timeline model — those are the intellectual property. The personal data is just the input.

The open-source play would be: framework is open, your specific signals and positions are your proprietary layer (or your consulting deliverable). Think of it like how Elasticsearch is open but Elastic's managed service is the business. Your macro thesis becomes the "index" that other people's careers trade against.

The risk: if the framework is too simple once exposed, it loses its mystique. The opportunity: if it's genuinely rigorous, open-sourcing it builds the credibility that makes the $8-15K engagements sell themselves.

What's your gut on which of these directions pulls you? The displacement simulator feels like the highest-leverage move given where you are right now — it directly supports the consulting product ladder you've already designed.

I want you to give me a list of all of the recommendations you think we should make I wanna polish this up to be fantastic. I know there's other versions we want to ship, but given we have this rich understanding of what it needs to be improved, this is a perfect opportunity to put something of the highest quality craft out there while the same time allowing me toverify and test out my new unified development pipelines for example, now we're starting with a second iteration I know we wouldn't start it at the beginning, but we should throw this back into the unified pipeline to correct an update. And something else I want to do is I want my personal dashboard for myself. I still want it to be plugged into Claude code and all of that good stuff, but what I wanna do can currently is create an open source version that will allow people to essentially brin to be able to power everything including their own information and their own data. And I absolutely want to add that layer that is the layer. That's really kind of a layer for people like me right I am no macroeconomic person. I don't know how all of it works so being able to explain it teach it to me how to bridge the gap that is going to be powerful too.

yes /spec

Base directory for this skill: /Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/ALOS/.claude/skills/spec

# /spec — Product Spec → Tasks → Ship

Capture what you're building, break it into tasks an AI agent can one-shot, and scale to parallel worktrees when the project is big.

## Usage

```bash
/spec                     # Start spec interview for current project
/spec from <file>         # Parse existing spec/PRD document
/spec tasks               # Show current task decomposition
/spec status              # Check implementation progress
```

## The Pipeline

```
SPEC → FEATURES → TASKS → (worktrees if big) → SHIP
```

---

## Phase 0: Load Upstream Context

Before starting the interview, check for existing artifacts:

1. **`CLARITY-BRIEF.md`** — If it exists, read it. Pre-fill answers from the clarity brief instead of re-asking. Show the user what was imported: "I loaded your clarity brief. Here's what I already know: [summary]. Let me fill in the gaps."
2. **`SPEC.md`** — If it exists, switch to update mode (see "Updating a Spec" below).

---

## Phase 1: Capture the Spec

### Option A: Interview Mode (default)

Ask these 5 questions. Keep answers tight — this is a 5-minute exercise, not a planning retreat.

**1. What does it do?**
> 2-3 sentences. If you can't explain it in 3 sentences, you don't know what you're building yet.

**2. Who is it for?**
> One user type + their use case. "Teachers who need to generate lesson plans from standards."

**3. Core features?**
> List 3-8 features. Each one line. If it's more than 8, you're building two products.

**4. Constraints?**
> Platform, cost ceiling, dependencies, timeline, tech stack. What CAN'T you do?

**5. Done when?**
> 3 concrete acceptance criteria. How do you know it's finished? "A user can X, Y, and Z."

### Option B: Parse Existing Spec

If the user provides a file (`/spec from SPEC.md` or `/spec from prd.txt`):

1. Read the document
2. Extract the 5 sections above from whatever format they wrote
3. Present back for confirmation: "Here's what I extracted — correct?"
4. If missing sections, ask only for what's missing

### AI Project Check

**If the project involves AI interactions** (LLM calls, model inference, AI-generated content):

Surface the AI Interaction Atlas framework. Ask:
- What AI tasks? (classify, generate, verify, etc.)
- What human tasks? (review, approve, edit?)
- What constraints? (latency, cost, safety, oversight level?)

Reference: `Kosha Prime/Reference/AI-Interaction-Atlas.md`

**If the project is React/RN with AI-generated UI for end users:**

Surface json-render as a tool option.
Reference: `Kosha Prime/Reference/JSON-Render-Generative-UI.md`

---

## Phase 2: Decompose into Features

Take each core feature from the spec and define:

```markdown
### Feature: [Name]

**What:** [One sentence]
**Depends on:** [Other features, or "None"]
**Files:** [Expected files/directories this touches]
**Acceptance:** [How to verify it works]
```

Order features by dependency — what must exist before what?

Output a dependency graph:

```
Feature A (no deps)
Feature B (no deps)
Feature C → depends on A
Feature D → depends on A, B
Feature E → depends on C, D
```

---

## Phase 3: Decompose Features into Tasks

For EACH feature, generate 3-7 atomic tasks. Each task must be:

- **One-shottable** — Claude can complete it in a single session
- **Testable** — You can verify it works
- **Scoped** — Touches a clear set of files

Format:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

- [ ] [Task 1] — [what to build, which files]
- [ ] [Task 2] — [what to build, which files]
- [ ] [Task 3] — [what to build, which files]
```

### Task Quality Check

Before outputting, verify each task against:

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| Can Claude one-shot this? | If no → break it down further |
| Is the scope clear? | If no → specify files/functions |
| Can you test it? | If no → add acceptance criteria |
| Does it depend on another task? | If yes → mark the dependency |

### Execution-Grade Task Blocks (Optional)

When tasks will be dispatched to sub-agents (Sonnet teammates, Codex, Kimi) or need maximum specificity, upgrade task blocks to execution-grade. The bar: **a builder should never need to ask a clarifying question.**

Use when:
- Dispatching to external agents via `/dispatch-plan` or `/triad`
- Using Claude Code agent teams (`TeamCreate`)
- Tasks touch unfamiliar codebases or complex integrations

Format for execution-grade tasks:

```markdown
## Task: [Name]

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/path/to/file.ts` — [what to create or change]
- `src/path/to/other.ts` — [what to create or change]

**Interfaces/Types:**
```ts
// Key types the builder needs (from existing codebase or new)
interface UserPayload {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}
```

**Skeleton:**
```ts
// Starting point — builder fills in implementation
export function validateUser(payload: UserPayload): Result<User, ValidationError> {
  // 1. Check email format
  // 2. Verify role is valid
  // 3. Return User or error
}
```

**Test Cases:**
| Test | Input | Expected Output |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Valid user | `{ id: "1", email: "a@b.com", role: "user" }` | `Ok(User)` |
| Invalid email | `{ id: "1", email: "bad", role: "user" }` | `Err(InvalidEmail)` |
| Missing role | `{ id: "1", email: "a@b.com" }` | `Err(MissingField)` |

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] No new dependencies added
- [ ] Follows existing error handling pattern in `src/errors.ts`
```

**When NOT to use execution-grade:** Standard `/forge` runs where Claude has full context. Over-specifying wastes time when the builder can read the codebase.

---

## Phase 4: Scale Decision

Count features and assess independence:

| Project Size | Features | Independent? | Approach |
|-------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Small** | 1-3 | — | Sequential. Just work through tasks in order. |
| **Medium** | 4-6 | Some | Sequential with suggested groupings. |
| **Large** | 7+ | Yes | Parallel. Suggest `/parallel-forge` with worktree mapping. |

### When to Suggest Worktrees

Suggest `/parallel-forge` when ALL of these are true:
- 5+ features
- At least 3 features are independent (no shared dependencies)
- Features touch different files (minimal conflict risk)

Output a worktree mapping:

```markdown
## Parallel Implementation Plan

### Worktree 1: [feature-a]
Branch: `forge/project/feature-a`
Tasks: [list]
Files owned: [list]

### Worktree 2: [feature-b]
Branch: `forge/project/feature-b`
Tasks: [list]
Files owned: [list]

### Sequential (after merge):
- Feature C (depends on A)
- Feature D (depends on A + B)

### Merge Order: feature-a, feature-b → feature-c → feature-d
```

If the project is small, skip this entirely. Don't over-engineer a 3-feature project with worktrees.

---

## Phase 5: Write Files

### Always Create:

**`$PROJECT_ROOT/SPEC.md`** — The spec document

```markdown
---
created: [date]
status: active
---

# [Project Name] Spec

## What it does
[From interview]

## Who it's for
[From interview]

## Core features
1. [Feature]
2. [Feature]
...

## Constraints
[From interview]

## Done when
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
```

**`$PROJECT_ROOT/productivity/TODO.md`** — Tasks by feature

```markdown
# TODO

## Feature: [Name] (no deps)
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
- [ ] [Task 3]

## Feature: [Name] (depends on: Feature A)
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]

## Implementation Order
1. [Feature A] — start here
2. [Feature B] — parallel with A
3. [Feature C] — after A completes
```

### For Large Projects (worktree path), Also Create:

**`$PROJECT_ROOT/DECOMPOSITION.md`** — Worktree plan (consumed by `/parallel-forge scaffold`)

This follows the parallel-forge template format with units, dependencies, merge order, and file ownership.

---

## Output

After all phases, output:

```
## Spec Complete: [Project Name]

**Features:** [count]
**Tasks:** [count]
**Approach:** Sequential | Parallel ([N] worktrees)

### Implementation Order
1. [Feature] — [task count] tasks
2. [Feature] — [task count] tasks (depends on #1)
...

### Files Created
- SPEC.md — product spec
- productivity/TODO.md — task breakdown
[- DECOMPOSITION.md — worktree plan (if parallel)]

### Next Step
[If project has 3+ features OR external APIs OR multiple viable approaches]:
  "Run `/design` to make architecture decisions before building."
[If UI project]:
  "Run `/design` for architecture, then `/design-explore` for visual direction."
[If simple, sequential]:
  "Start with Feature 1. Run: help me implement [first task]"
[If parallel]:
  "Run `/design` first, then `/parallel-forge scaffold [project] [units]` to create worktrees"
```

---

## Updating a Spec

If the project already has a SPEC.md:

```bash
/spec                    # Detects existing SPEC.md, asks what changed
/spec add-feature        # Add a new feature + decompose
/spec re-scope           # Revisit constraints or cut features
```

Read the existing spec, show it, ask what's changed. Update SPEC.md and regenerate affected tasks in TODO.md.

---

## Constraints

- **5-minute exercise** — Don't let spec capture drag on. If answers aren't clear, that's a signal to `/clarify` first.
- **No over-engineering** — 3-feature project gets a TODO, not a DECOMPOSITION.md with worktrees.
- **Tasks must be one-shottable** — If Claude can't finish it in one session, it's too big.
- **Spec is living** — Update it as you build. It's a reference, not a contract.
- **Files stay in the project** — SPEC.md and TODO.md live in the repo, not in Kosha Prime.

---

## Integration with Other Skills

| Trigger | Skill | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| AI project detected | Surface AI Interaction Atlas | Think through AI tasks, human tasks, constraints |
| React + AI-generated UI | Surface json-render | Guardrailed generative UI framework |
| 5+ independent features | Suggest `/parallel-forge` | Worktree-based parallel implementation |
| Unclear vision | Suggest `/clarify` first | Sharpen thinking before speccing |
| New project | Run after `/scaffold-project` | Scaffold structure, then spec features |
| 3+ features or external APIs | Suggest `/design` next | Architecture decisions before building |
| UI project | Suggest `/design` then `/design-explore` | Architecture + visual direction |
| Complex feature | Suggest `/forge` | Single-feature autonomous implementation |

---

## Examples

### Small Project (Sequential)

```
/spec

## Spec Complete: price-alert-bot

**Features:** 3
**Tasks:** 9
**Approach:** Sequential

### Implementation Order
1. Price fetcher — 3 tasks
2. Alert rules engine — 3 tasks (depends on #1)
3. Notification sender — 3 tasks (depends on #2)

### Next Step
Start with Feature 1. Run: "help me implement the price fetcher"
```

### Large Project (Parallel)

```
/spec

## Spec Complete: Tutelage

### Next Step
Run `/parallel-forge scaffold tutelage content-engine,quiz-system,progress-tracker,settings-ui`
```


ARGUMENTS: AsymmetricBridge v2 - Polish iteration with 33 recommendations across architecture split (personal + OSS), new features (Thesis Performance Lab, Conviction Ledger, Signal Digest Engine, Educational Layer), UX polish, technical debt, and unified pipeline integration.

I would also like to see another variant of design. This one looks like a Bloomberg terminal. I feel like that may be daunting for a few people is there maybe another design we could make and we can make a concurrently?

# Design Explore

Try multiple visual directions for your app, compare them, and lock in a style. This is the "try random styles until something clicks" step — but structured.

## Usage

```
/design-explore                         # Interactive — asks about the project
/design-explore <screen-inventory.md>   # Use existing screen inventory
/design-explore --styles 5              # Generate 5 directions (default: 3)
/design-explore --style "editorial"     # Explore a specific aesthetic
```

## Why This Exists

> "I feed that screen list to Variant AI, Aura.build, v0, Superdesign, and try random styles until something clicks."
> "These experiments more often than not fail and I pivot back to my default style. That's fine. The point is to try."

Design exploration shouldn't be random. Structure the experimentation so you learn from every direction — even the ones that fail.

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect information before generating anything:

1. **Screen inventory** — Use existing `SCREEN-INVENTORY.md` or run `/screen-inventory`
2. **Current design** — Use existing `DESIGN.md` or run `/design-extract`, or skip if greenfield
3. **App category** — What kind of app is this? (productivity, kids/education, fitness, social, business, creative tool, etc.)
4. **Target audience** — Who uses this? (parents, developers, students, professionals, etc.)
5. **Emotional tone** — How should it feel? (calm, energetic, playful, serious, premium, approachable)
6. **References** — Any apps, sites, or designs that inspire the user (ask for these)

If a `/clarify` brief exists, use it. Don't re-ask what's already answered.

### Step 2: Select Key Screens

Pick 2-3 representative screens to design — don't try to redesign every screen at once:

| Priority | Screen Type | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| 1st | **Home/Dashboard** | Sets the tone for the whole app |
| 2nd | **Core action screen** | The thing users come here to do |
| 3rd | **Detail/content screen** | Tests readability and information hierarchy |

Present the selection to the user for approval before generating.

### Step 3: Generate Visual Directions

Generate 3-5 distinct directions. Each direction should be **meaningfully different**, not variations of the same idea.

**Direction template:**

| Direction | Aesthetic | Typography | Color | Layout | Inspiration |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| A | Minimal editorial | Serif headings, mono body | Monochrome + 1 accent | Generous whitespace, left-aligned | Linear, iA Writer |
| B | Warm & approachable | Rounded sans-serif | Warm neutrals, soft pastels | Card-based, generous radius | Notion, Headspace |
| C | Bold & modern | Geometric sans, heavy weights | High contrast, dark base | Dense grid, sharp edges | Vercel, Raycast |
| D | Playful & tactile | Display font headings | Vibrant primaries | Stacked, rounded, shadows | Duolingo, Pitch |
| E | Premium minimal | Thin sans-serif | Muted earth tones | Airy, centered, lots of space | Apple, Aesop |

**Rules for generation:**
- At least one direction should be the user's "default style" if known (e.g., "simple and minimalistic with a focus on typography")
- At least one direction should push outside the user's comfort zone
- Each direction must specify: font choices, color palette (hex values), spacing philosophy, corner radius, shadow style, and motion approach
- Generate working code (HTML/CSS or framework-appropriate) for the selected key screens in each direction

**Generation tools** (use what's available):
1. `/frontend-design` with specific style prompts — primary tool
2. `/design-ui` (Stitch) for quick visual iterations
3. Direct HTML/CSS generation for rapid prototyping

### Step 4: Present the Comparison

Output a structured comparison:

```markdown
# Design Exploration: [Project Name]

**Screens explored:** [list]
**Directions generated:** [count]
**Date:** [date]

---

## Direction A: [Name] — "Editorial Calm"

**Aesthetic:** Minimal, editorial, typography-driven
**Fonts:** DM Serif Display (headings), Inter (body)
**Colors:** #1A1A1A, #F5F3EF, #E85D3A (accent)
**Radius:** 2px (sharp and intentional)
**Shadows:** None (flat, uses borders)
**Motion:** Subtle fade-ins, 200ms ease-out

**Strengths:** Timeless, easy to read, professional
**Risk:** Could feel cold or boring for a [category] app

[Screenshot or link to generated code]

---

## Direction B: [Name] — "Warm Workshop"

...

---

## Side-by-Side Summary

| Aspect | A: Editorial | B: Warm | C: Bold |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Tone | Serious | Friendly | Energetic |
| Readability | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ |
| Personality | ★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| Consistency ease | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ |
| Audience fit | [rating] | [rating] | [rating] |

---

## My Recommendation

[1-2 sentences on which direction best fits the app's purpose and audience, with reasoning]
```

### Step 5: Capture the Chosen Direction

After the user picks a direction (or mixes elements from multiple), capture it as a **Design Brief**:

```markdown
# Design Brief: [Project Name]

**Chosen Direction:** [Name]
**Date:** [date]

## Visual Identity

**Typography:**
- Headings: [Font], [weight], [sizes for H1/H2/H3]
- Body: [Font], [weight], [size], [line-height]
- Mono/code: [Font] (if applicable)

**Color Palette:**
- Background: [hex]
- Surface: [hex]
- Text primary: [hex]
- Text secondary: [hex]
- Accent: [hex]
- Success/Error/Warning: [hex each]

**Spacing:**
- Base unit: [4px/8px]
- Scale: [list]
- Section gap: [value]
- Component padding: [value]

**Shape:**
- Corner radius: [value]
- Border style: [value]
- Shadow: [value]

**Motion:**
- Duration: [value]
- Easing: [value]
- Entrance: [pattern]

## Application Rules

- [Specific rule about how to apply this style]
- [Another rule]
- [Edge case handling]

## Reference Screens

[Links to the generated code for each key screen in the chosen style]
```

Save this as `DESIGN-BRIEF.md` in the project root. This document feeds into `/frontend-design` and `/design-review` for all future screens.

## Integration with Design Pipeline

```
/screen-inventory → /design-extract → /design-explore → Apply chosen style → /design-review → /baseline-ui
                                            ↑
                                   Outputs DESIGN-BRIEF.md
                                   (feeds all future design work)
```

## Tips

- **Don't skip the ugly directions.** Exploring styles you don't like clarifies what you do like.
- **Mix and match.** The best design often combines the typography of Direction A with the colors of Direction C.
- **Your default is fine.** If experiments fail, falling back to "simple and minimal with good typography" is a valid — and strong — choice.
- **Save everything.** Even rejected directions inform future projects. The generated code is free reference material.
- **2-3 screens, not all screens.** Design the key screens first. Consistency tools (`/design-review`, `/baseline-ui`) handle the rest.


ARGUMENTS: AsymmetricBridge at /Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/ — currently has a dark "Bloomberg Terminal" aesthetic (IBM Plex Sans/Mono, #0D0D0F background, dense data tables, monospace labels, signal status dots). Want to explore 3-5 alternative visual directions that could run as a concurrent variant alongside the current design. The audience is expanding from a single power user to OSS users who may not have finance backgrounds. The educational layer (glossary tooltips, guided tour, simplified mode) needs a design that feels approachable, not intimidating. Keep the current Bloomberg variant as Direction 1 for comparison.

I want to stay in the flow of the unified pipeline. So you tell me what we should do next and then let's do that so that we make sure that we hit all aspects of the pipeline to ensure we have the highest quality the output possible.

# Parallel Forge

Run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously using git worktrees. Based on research from Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) and the incident.io team.

## Recommended Output Style

> 💡 Parallel execution works best in **War Room** mode: `/mode war`

## The Pattern

```
DECOMPOSE → SCAFFOLD → DISPATCH → INTEGRATE → SYNC
```

1. **DECOMPOSE**: Break work into independent units with clear interfaces
2. **SCAFFOLD**: Create git worktrees + BRIEF.md files for each unit
3. **DISPATCH**: Launch Claude Code in each worktree terminal
4. **INTEGRATE**: Merge in dependency order, verify, cleanup
5. **SYNC**: Update ALOS documentation (Brief.md, Chronicle.md, QUESTIONS.md)

## Invocation

```bash
/parallel-forge                    # Start decomposition wizard
/parallel-forge status             # Check all worktree statuses
/parallel-forge scaffold <name>    # Create worktrees from DECOMPOSITION.md
/parallel-forge integrate          # Merge completed units
/parallel-forge sync               # Update ALOS docs after merge
/parallel-forge cleanup            # Remove merged worktrees
```

## Key Insights (From Research)

| Source | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| Boris Cherny | "A good plan is really important!" - Use plan mode first |
| Boris Cherny | 10-20% of parallel sessions get abandoned - this is expected |
| Boris Cherny | "Verification loops are probably the most important thing" |
| incident.io | Git worktrees (not clones) - lighter weight, shared history |
| incident.io | Plan mode for safety: "You can confidently leave Claude running" |

## Phase 1: DECOMPOSE

When you run `/parallel-forge`, I'll help you break your project into parallel units.

### Decomposition Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Vertical Slice** | Feature with UI + API + DB | Login: UI, API, Schema |
| **Interface-First** | Components that talk to each other | Define interfaces, implement in parallel |
| **Pipeline** | Data flows through stages | Ingest → Transform → Store |
| **Core + Periphery** | Central logic + integrations | Engine + Adapters |

### Output: DECOMPOSITION.md

The decomposition phase produces a file listing:
- Unit names and descriptions
- Dependencies (which units block others)
- Merge order (topological sort)
- Owned files per unit (to prevent conflicts)

## Phase 2: SCAFFOLD

Run `scaffold.sh` to create worktrees:

```bash
cd .claude/skills/parallel-forge
./scaffold.sh <project-name> <unit1,unit2,unit3>
```

This creates:
- `../<ProjectName>-forge/` sibling directory
- One worktree per unit with its own branch
- Customized BRIEF.md in each worktree
- FORGE_LOG.md template for capturing decisions

### Worktree Structure

```
Projects/
├── MyProject/                      # Main repo (you stay here)
├── MyProject-forge/                # Parallel worktrees
│   ├── unit-a/                     # Branch: forge/myproject/unit-a
│   │   ├── BRIEF.md                # Mission + constraints
│   │   └── FORGE_LOG.md            # Decisions + learnings
│   ├── unit-b/                     # Branch: forge/myproject/unit-b
│   └── unit-c/                     # Branch: forge/myproject/unit-c
```

## Phase 3: DISPATCH

Launch Claude Code in each worktree terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main orchestrator (stays in main repo)
# Terminal 2:
cd ../MyProject-forge/unit-a && claude

# Terminal 3:
cd ../MyProject-forge/unit-b && claude

# Terminal 4:
cd ../MyProject-forge/unit-c && claude
```

Each Claude instance reads its BRIEF.md on startup and knows:
- What to build
- Which files it owns
- What NOT to touch
- The review protocol (Codex, Gemini)

### Review Protocol (MANDATORY)

Each unit must pass review BEFORE marking READY:

1. **Codex Code Review** (all units)
   - Hand off to Codex: `/triad codex "Review [unit] for code quality"`
   - Address feedback

2. **Gemini UI/UX Review** (UI units only)
   - Hand off to Gemini: `/triad gemini "Review [unit] UI for accessibility"`
   - Address feedback

3. **Log to FORGE_LOG.md**
   - Key decisions made
   - Codex feedback addressed
   - Gemini feedback addressed (if applicable)

4. **Create READY commit**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "READY: unit-name"
   git push -u origin forge/project/unit-name
   ```

## Phase 4: INTEGRATE

When all units show READY commits:

```bash
cd .claude/skills/parallel-forge
./integrate.sh <project-name> <merge-order>
```

The script:
- Verifies READY status on each branch
- Checks FORGE_LOG.md exists
- Merges in dependency order
- Runs project verification (build, tests)

## Phase 5: SYNC (Critical for ALOS)

After merge, update documentation:

```bash
./sync-docs.sh <project-name>
```

Documents to update:

| Document | Location | What to Update |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Brief.md** | Kosha Prime | Recent Progress, Next Steps |
| **Chronicle.md** | Kosha Prime | New dated entry with session summary |
| **QUESTIONS.md** | git repo | Decisions made during parallel work |
| **TODO.md** | git repo | Completed items, new items discovered |

## Phase 6: CLEANUP

After successful integration:

```bash
./cleanup.sh <project-name>
```

This:
- Archives FORGE_LOG.md files to Kosha Prime
- Removes worktrees
- Deletes forge branches

## Example: Practice Pal

```bash
# 1. Decompose
/parallel-forge
# Creates DECOMPOSITION.md with 4 units

# 2. Scaffold
./scaffold.sh practicepal content-pipeline,math-engine,reading-flow,parent-guide

# 3. Dispatch (4 terminals)
cd ../PracticePal-forge/content-pipeline && claude
cd ../PracticePal-forge/math-engine && claude
cd ../PracticePal-forge/reading-flow && claude
# Wait for first 3, then:
cd ../PracticePal-forge/parent-guide && claude

# 4. Integrate (after all READY)
./integrate.sh practicepal content-pipeline,math-engine,reading-flow,parent-guide

# 5. Sync docs
./sync-docs.sh practicepal

# 6. Cleanup
./cleanup.sh practicepal
```

## Status Check

Run `/parallel-forge status` to see:
- All active worktrees
- Branch status (commits ahead/behind)
- READY status
- FORGE_LOG.md presence

## Tips

1. **Plan First**: Use `/parallel-forge` wizard to get decomposition right
2. **Clear Ownership**: Each unit must have exclusive file ownership
3. **Interface Contracts**: Define how units communicate before implementing
4. **Expect Abandonment**: 10-20% of sessions fail - this is normal
5. **Verification**: Each unit must pass Codex review before READY
6. **Document Decisions**: FORGE_LOG.md is critical for post-merge sync

ARGUMENTS: scaffold AsymmetricBridge config-layer,nav-architecture,backend-completion

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me carefully analyze the entire conversation chronologically:

1. **Opening**: User wants to polish AsymmetricBridge, provided Gemini's review and Claude web's review of Gemini's review. They want:
   - Review everything in its entirety
   - Think of 3 novel/innovative additions
   - Specifically wants brokerage upload for portfolio analysis (QoQ)
   
2. **Deep Exploration**: I launched an Explore agent to thoroughly review the AsymmetricBridge codebase at `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/`. Got back comprehensive details about:
   - Project structure, tech stack (Vite + React + Supabase)
   - All pages/sections, signal tracking system
   - 24 signals across 6 dominos
   - API integrations (FRED, Twelve Data, CoinGecko)
   - Database schema (5 tables)
   - Current design system

3. **My Review of Reviews**: I provided honest assessment of both Gemini and Claude's reviews, identified gaps neither addressed (no historical analysis, no feedback loop, portfolio section is declarative not connected, content generation is manual).

4. **Three Novel Additions Proposed**:
   - Thesis Performance Lab (brokerage CSV upload)
   - Conviction Ledger (prediction accountability)
   - Signal Digest Engine (automated intelligence briefs)

5. **User Request for Complete List**: User asked for ALL recommendations to polish it up. Also mentioned:
   - Wanting to test unified development pipeline
   - Creating an open source version
   - Adding educational layer for non-experts
   - Additional requests via messages during work: onboarding wizard for new users, resume ingestion tool

6. **33 Recommendations Compiled** across categories A-F:
   - A: Architecture Split (4 items)
   - B: New Features (7 items)
   - C: Polish UX/Design (9 items)
   - D: Educational Layer (4 items)
   - E: Technical Debt (8 items)
   - F: Content/Product Integration (3 items)

7. **User said "yes /spec"** - Invoked the spec skill

8. **Spec Execution**: Read existing artifacts:
   - SPEC.md (v1, 8 features)
   - CLARITY-BRIEF.md
   - ARCHITECTURE.md
   - productivity/TODO.md

9. **User additional requests during spec work**:
   - "like a resume ingestion tool would be amazing"
   - Onboarding wizard for new users

10. **Spec Files Created/Updated**:
    - SPEC.md updated to v2 (11 features, done-when criteria)
    - productivity/TODO.md (60 tasks across 11 features)
    - DECOMPOSITION.md (4 groups, worktree plan)
    - CLAUDE.md updated for v2

11. **Design Exploration**: User wanted alternative designs besides Bloomberg terminal. I ran /design-explore, asked preferences:
    - Inspiration: Stripe Dashboard + Apple Weather/Health
    - Mode: Both light and warm-dark
    - Generated 4 directions: Terminal (current), Swiss Clarity (light), Observatory (warm dark), Narrative (editorial light)
    - Recommended: Keep Terminal for personal, build Observatory for OSS

12. **Pipeline Discussion**: User wanted to stay in unified pipeline flow. I identified:
    - Phase 3 (/design - ARCHITECTURE.md update) needed for v2
    - Phase 4 (DESIGN-BRIEF.md capture) needed
    - Both could run in parallel

13. **Parallel Agent Execution**: Launched two background agents:
    - Architecture agent (update ARCHITECTURE.md with 7 new decisions)
    - Design Brief agent (create DESIGN-BRIEF.md)
    
14. **Both agents hit permissions issues** - couldn't use Write tool in background mode.

15. **DESIGN-BRIEF.md**: I wrote it myself with full specs for both Terminal and Observatory variants.

16. **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Architecture agent got stuck, I stopped it and wrote the 7 new decisions myself via Edit tool:
    - Decision 7: Configuration Layer Schema (JS Module)
    - Decision 8: Data Source Plugin Interface (Named Registry)
    - Decision 9: ThesisContext & Onboarding Data Model (Single Provider + localStorage)
    - Decision 10: Prediction Engine (Template-Based with Supabase)
    - Decision 11: Digest System (Template-Based, Manual Trigger)
    - Decision 12: Brokerage CSV Parsing (Papa Parse + Auto-Detection)
    - Decision 13: Dual-Variant Architecture (Theme Provider + Token Sets)
    - Also added v2 Supabase schema (portfolio_snapshots, portfolio_positions, predictions, digests tables)
    - Updated risk mitigation and reversibility tables

17. **Commit**: All v2 planning artifacts committed: `01f0258 feat: Add v2 spec, architecture, and design brief`

18. **User said "let's do it"** to start Phase 5 Build

19. **Parallel Forge Scaffold**: 
    - Read scaffold.sh and BRIEF.md template
    - Ran scaffold.sh creating 3 worktrees at `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/`:
      - config-layer (branch: forge/AsymmetricBridge/config-layer)
      - nav-architecture (branch: forge/AsymmetricBridge/nav-architecture)  
      - backend-completion (branch: forge/AsymmetricBridge/backend-completion)

20. **Customizing BRIEFs**: Attempted to Write customized BRIEF.md for each worktree with specific missions, owned files, constraints, interface contracts, and definitions of done. Got "File has not been read yet" errors on all three because the template BRIEFs were created by the shell script but I hadn't Read them first.

That's where we left off - need to Read the template BRIEFs first, then Write the customized versions.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (Fabian) wants to polish AsymmetricBridge to the highest quality, with these specific goals:
   - Review the project in its entirety using insights from Gemini and Claude web reviews
   - Identify 3 novel/innovative additions (specifically wants brokerage portfolio upload for QoQ analysis)
   - Create an open-source version where users bring their own thesis, data, and API keys
   - Add an educational layer that explains macro concepts to non-finance people
   - Add an onboarding wizard with resume ingestion for new OSS users
   - Explore alternative design directions beyond the Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic (chose Observatory warm-dark variant)
   - Follow the unified ALOS development pipeline rigorously for quality assurance
   - Execute the build via parallel-forge worktrees

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Tech Stack**: Vite 7.3.1 + React 19.2.0 + Supabase + TanStack Query v5
   - **APIs**: FRED (8 economic series), Twelve Data (7 stock tickers, batch endpoint), CoinGecko (stablecoin data)
   - **Signal System**: 24 signals across 6 dominos (9 auto-evaluated, 15 manual), threshold engine with declarative rules
   - **Domino Cascade**: 6 interconnected macro disruption vectors (SaaS Compression → White-Collar Displacement → Friction Collapse → Ghost GDP → Financial Contagion → Policy Response)
   - **ALOS Pipeline**: 8 phases (Scaffold → Clarify → Spec → Architecture → Visual Direction → Build → Quality → Ship)
   - **Parallel Forge**: Git worktree-based parallel development with BRIEF.md per unit
   - **Dual Visual Variants**: Terminal (IBM Plex, #0D0D0F, Bloomberg-style) + Observatory (Inter + JetBrains Mono, #0F1117, glass-morphism, Apple Weather-inspired)
   - **Theme Architecture**: Token-based ThemeProvider swapping design token sets
   - **Configuration Layer**: thesis.config.js schema, DataSourceRegistry plugin pattern, ThesisContext React provider
   - **Papa Parse**: Client-side CSV parsing for brokerage uploads (14KB)
   - **Prediction Engine**: Template-based predictions with 30/60/90 day evaluation windows

     - v1 vision doc, two-track strategy (Personal Supreme + OSS Framework)

   - **Key source files READ for context** (not modified):
     - `src/data/dominos.js` — 6 dominos with 24 signals, thresholds, data points
     - `src/styles.js` — STATUS_CFG (green/amber/red), S.card/tab/sectionTab/label factories, Badge component
     - `src/index.css` — Global dark theme, IBM Plex fonts from Google Fonts CDN
     - `src/components/CommandCenter.jsx` — 1440 LOC monolith (first 200 lines read)

   - **Worktree BRIEFs** (ATTEMPTED to write, got errors):
     - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/config-layer/BRIEF.md`
     - `REDACTED.md`
     - `REDACTED.md`
     - Each has detailed mission, tasks, owned files, do-not-touch files, interface contracts, constraints, and definition of done

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Background agents couldn't write files**: Both the Architecture and Design Brief agents (launched via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`) were denied Write tool permissions. The Design Brief agent also couldn't use Bash.
     - Fix: Stopped the stuck agents and wrote the files directly from the main conversation context.
   - **Output file too large to parse**: The agent output file at `REDACTED.output` exceeded 25000 tokens and couldn't be read even with offset/limit.
     - User asked "too large to parse, can you use sonnet to parse?"
     - Fix: I already had all the content from my design exploration prompts, so I wrote DESIGN-BRIEF.md directly without needing to parse the agent output.
   - **Architecture agent stuck in edit loop**: Agent `a4e8eb079e0b6af15` was denied Write, tried Edit with 430-line replacement, got stuck.
     - Fix: Stopped the agent with TaskStop, read the existing file, used incremental Edit operations to add v2 content.
   - **Write tool "File has not been read" error**: When trying to Write customized BRIEF.md files to the forge worktrees, got errors because scaffold.sh created template files that I hadn't Read first.
     - Fix: Not yet fixed — this is where the conversation stopped.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved the dual-audience problem identified by Claude's review by designing the Educational Layer (Feature 4) with glossary tooltips, progressive disclosure, and Simplified/Full mode
   - Solved the staleness problem by designing Signal Freshness Indicators (Feature 5) and the Conviction Ledger (Feature 7) which keeps the system active even when manual signals are stale
   - Solved the OSS extraction challenge by designing the Configuration Layer (Feature 1) with thesis-schema.js, DataSourceRegistry, and ThesisContext
   - Solved the design accessibility problem by exploring 4 visual directions and selecting Observatory as the approachable alternative to Bloomberg Terminal
   - Ongoing: Setting up parallel forge worktrees for Group A build phase

6. All User Messages:
   - "I want to focus on polishing up AsymmetricBridge..." [Long message with Gemini review and Claude's review of Gemini's review, requesting 3 novel additions, specifically mentioning brokerage upload for QoQ analysis]
   - "I want you to give me a list of all of the recommendations you think we should make I wanna polish this up to be fantastic..." [Requesting comprehensive recommendation list, mentioning unified pipeline, open source version, educational layer]
   - "yes /spec" [Approving spec execution]
   - "like a resume ingestion tool would amazing" [Additional feature request during spec work]
   - "I also want there to be a wizard or an on boarding mechanism for new users so we make sure that they get everything that they need in there as far as their own data and their key. And the data I'm related to their career information or career goals, and aspirations." [Onboarding wizard requirement]
   - "I would also like to see another variant of design. This one looks like a Bloomberg terminal. I feel like that may be daunting for a few people is there maybe another design we could make and we can make a concurrently?" [Design exploration request]
   - Selected: Stripe Dashboard + Apple Weather/Health as inspiration, "Both — show me one of each" for light vs dark
   - "I want to stay in the flow of the unified pipeline. So you tell me what we should do next..." [Following pipeline rigorously]
   - "Go ahead and execute this plan" [Approving Phase 3 + Phase 4 parallel execution]
   - "What? too large to parse, can you use sonnet to parse?" [Regarding agent output file]
   - "are you still working?" [Checking on architecture agent progress]
   - "let's do it" [Approving Phase 5 Build kickoff with parallel-forge scaffold]

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Immediate**: Read the 3 template BRIEF.md files in the forge worktrees, then Write the customized versions with missions, owned files, interface contracts, and constraints
   - **After BRIEFs**: User needs to launch Claude Code in each worktree terminal to start the parallel build
   - **Group A Build**: 3 parallel worktrees (config-layer: 5 tasks, nav-architecture: 6 tasks, backend-completion: 5 tasks)
   - **Groups B/C/D**: 44 remaining tasks across 8 features after Group A merge
   - **Quality Phase**: /design-review → /baseline-ui → /fixing-accessibility → /fixing-metadata
   - **Ship Phase**: PR, deploy, tag v2.0.0

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of customizing the BRIEF.md files for the 3 Group A worktrees. The scaffold.sh script ran successfully, creating:
   - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/config-layer/`
   - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/nav-architecture/`
   - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/`
   
   Each has template BRIEF.md and FORGE_LOG.md created by the script. I attempted to Write all 3 customized BRIEFs simultaneously but got "File has not been read yet" errors because the scaffold.sh created the template files and I need to Read them before overwriting with Write.

   The customized BRIEF content for all 3 worktrees is fully composed (included in the failed Write calls) with detailed missions, task lists, owned files, do-not-touch files, interface contracts, constraints, and definitions of done.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Read the 3 template BRIEF.md files in the forge worktrees, then Write the customized versions. The exact content for each is already composed from the failed Write attempts above.
   
   User's last message before summary request: **"let's do it"** in response to "Want me to kick off the build? I'd start with `/parallel-forge scaffold` to create Group A worktrees."
   
   After the BRIEFs are written, provide the user with the terminal commands to launch Claude Code in each worktree:
   ```
   cd /Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/config-layer && claude
   cd /Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/nav-architecture && claude
   cd /Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion && claude
   ```

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/fabianaguilar/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

---

commit and push, and are we using codex and gemini

---

Let's follow your plan for skipping on Group A

---

I'm using the Codex map. Research so you know how it works. Now give me the prompts and the names of the Git tree names. Remember, no need to instruct Codex to create the git tree,we will already be working with them.

---

here is the output from the backend completeltion: Implemented the Configuration & Theming layer with backward compatibility preserved.

Updated files:
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/config/thesis-schema.js`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/config/fabian-thesis.js`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/config/ThesisContext.jsx`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/lib/data-sources.js`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/data/dominos.js`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/data/sources.js`
- `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/main.jsx`

What’s done against your checklist:
1. `validateThesis(config)` implemented and returns `{ valid, errors }` with specific path-based messages.
2. `fabian-thesis.js` now contains all extracted thesis data:
   - 6 dominos
   - 24 signals
   - all signal thresholds/dataPoints
   - all source materials
   - 5 portfolio legs
   - required `meta` + `careerProfile`
3. `ThesisProvider` + `useThesis()` implemented with localStorage key `ab-thesis-config`, fallback to Fabian default, and API `{ thesis, updateThesis, isLoaded }`.
4. `DataSourceRegistry` implemented with `register/get/list`, pre-registered adapters:
   - `fred`
   - `twelve_data`
   - `coingecko`
5. `src/data/dominos.js` and `src/data/sources.js` now re-export from config for backward compatibility, so existing imports keep working unchanged.

Verification run:
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm run dev` startup smoke test passes (Vite ready).
- Runtime browser check confirms `DataSourceRegistry.list()` returns:
  - `["fred","twelve_data","coingecko"]`
- Schema checks confirm default config is valid and malformed configs are rejected with concrete errors.

Note:
- I could not find a literal `BRIEF.md` file in this repo; I executed based on your task spec in-message.

---

We're still waiting on the config layer, work treatment, and the NAV architectural work tree

---

But we really have to show up this discrepancy between you creating Work trees and then me create them locally on the Codex app. It feels like we're wasting so much so many tokens because we're creating trees that don't even get created.

---

Implemented in `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion`:

1. Added generic retry utility with exponential backoff + jitter + attempt tracking  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/lib/retry.js:15`

2. Hardened all 3 adapters with retry + 429 detection + structured error shape  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/lib/fred.js:165`  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/lib/stocks.js:151`  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/lib/crypto.js:114`  
Error shape now returns: `{ data: null, error: { code, message, retryable, source }, attempts }` on failures.

3. Added environment validator and startup logging  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/lib/env-check.js:13`  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/src/main.jsx:5`

4. Created Supabase Edge Function with `Deno.serve()` for cron evaluation  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/supabase/functions/evaluate-thresholds/index.ts:154`  
Returns `{ evaluated, changed, errors }`, updates `signal_statuses`, writes `signal_history`, skips overrides, includes idempotency window.

5. Rewrote `/signal-update` skill doc in requested command style  
`/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge-forge/backend-completion/.claude/skills/signal-update/SKILL.md:1`

Verification run:
- `npm run lint` passed
- `npm run dev` passed (`VITE v7.3.1 ready`, local URL started)
- `npm run build` passed

Notes:
- I could not fully validate Edge Function serving/deploy locally because Docker daemon is not running (`supabase functions serve ...` fails on Docker prerequisite).
- Since current DB schema still uses `green|amber|red`, I documented `baseline|watch|alert` compatibility mapping in the skill and evaluator normalization.

---

I think I may have done this on the actual main tree

---

[Image: source: /Users/fabianaguilar/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-02-23 at 1.57.24 PM.png]

---

I feel like I really fumbled the ball here

---

This is a huge mistake

---

Here is the final work done by Codex: Implemented all 6 deliverables in `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge` (the requested `.../AsymmetricBridge-forge/nav-architecture` path was not present when I finished).

**What changed**
- Added persistent route nav with active state + mobile hamburger:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/Navigation.jsx:1`
- Added class-based error boundary with retry + console logging:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx:1`
- Added skeleton components:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/Skeleton.jsx:1`
- Added pulse animation keyframes:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/index.css:10`
- Decomposed monolith into lucid-box subcomponents:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/lucid-box/LucidBoxHeader.jsx:1`

  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/lucid-box/LucidBoxSignals.jsx:1`
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/lucid-box/LucidBoxPortfolio.jsx:1`
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/lucid-box/LucidBoxMarket.jsx:1`
- Replaced `CommandCenter` with thin shell (now 192 LOC), state/data-fetching remains there, passed via props:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/CommandCenter.jsx:1`
- Updated routing to required paths and placeholders:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/App.jsx:1`
  - Routes: `/`, `/performance`, `/conviction`, `/digests`
- Cleaned `ThesisPortfolio` duplication by using `DOMINOS` + `SOURCES` imports:
  - `/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/ThesisPortfolio.jsx:1`

**Validation**
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm run dev` starts successfully (`http://localhost:5173/`) when run with elevated permissions.

If you want, I can now stage and commit these changes with a concise message.

---

Before we move on, did you do any research on the Codex app for macOS under exactly how it works

---

OK, I wanna work with it with tree with Work trees to be honest with you just because that'll be faster and smoother won't it and it's more in line with modern orchestration best practices for agentic workflows. Give me the code prompt. Give me what I should call the next branch and I will do it correct this time and I will double verify before we move forward.

---

yes commit it first

---

Here is the codex prompt, and I named the tree 'back-endv2' Implemented all 5 backend-hardening deliverables with additive changes and preserved adapter function signatures.

---

done, what's next

---

[Image: source: /Users/fabianaguilar/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-02-23 at 2.28.33 PM.png]

---

Let's do it!

---

ran them all. Here's is what codex gave me from the 5th prompt, which I ran after the first four had finished: Implemented all 5 deliverables plus responsive behavior and verification.

**What I changed**
- Created Terminal token set: [terminal.js](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/design-tokens/terminal.js:1)
- Created Observatory token set (including `useGlass` + glass tokens): [observatory.js](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/design-tokens/observatory.js:1)
- Created shared tokens (`breakpoints`, `zIndex`, status semantics): [shared.js](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/design-tokens/shared.js:1)
- Added theme system (`ThemeProvider`, `useTheme`, `ThemeToggle`, localStorage sync on `ab-theme-variant`, synchronous initial read to prevent flash): [index.js](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/design-tokens/index.js:14)
- Refactored style factories to token-aware while preserving API (`S.card`, `S.tab`, `S.sectionTab`, `S.label`, `Badge`): [styles.js](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/styles.js:52)

**App wiring**
- Wrapped app with `ThemeProvider`: [main.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/main.jsx:24)
- Made shell/background/typography token-driven via `useTheme`: [App.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/App.jsx:88)
- Added `ThemeToggle` into desktop and mobile navigation; nav now token-driven and content-width-aware: [Navigation.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/Navigation.jsx:25)
- Updated command center shell to theme tokens and responsive max-width utility: [CommandCenter.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/CommandCenter.jsx:273)

**Responsive + breakpoint work**
- Added breakpoint CSS custom properties and responsive media rules in global CSS.
- Added Observatory font imports (Inter + JetBrains Mono) in CSS.
- Added responsive content-width utility (`.ab-content-shell`) and mobile stack behavior + overflow guards.
- Files: [index.css](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/index.css:1), [PerformanceView.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/performance-lab/PerformanceView.jsx:119), [LucidBoxSignals.jsx](/Users/fabianaguilar/Projects/AsymmetricBridge/src/components/lucid-box/LucidBoxSignals.jsx:29)

**Validation**
- `npm run build` passes.
- Mobile overflow check at 375px (browser eval): `scrollWidth <= viewportWidth` (`hasOverflow: false`) on `/`.

If you want, next step is a focused pass to token-ize remaining hardcoded font/color usages outside `src/styles.js` so Observatory typography/colors are even more consistent across every inline style block.

lets

I completed these. I have not committed the last seven prompts, this group.

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

**Session Start (continued from previous context compression)**
The conversation was continued from a previous session that had already:
- Reviewed AsymmetricBridge thoroughly using Gemini and Claude web reviews
- Proposed 33 recommendations across 6 categories
- Created SPEC.md v2 (11 features, 60 tasks)
- Created DECOMPOSITION.md (4 groups, worktree plan)
- Created DESIGN-BRIEF.md (Terminal + Observatory variants)
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with 7 new decisions
- Committed all v2 planning artifacts
- Scaffolded 3 forge worktrees for Group A

The session was picking up from a failed attempt to write customized BRIEF.md files to forge worktrees (got "File has not been read" errors).

**Phase 1: Completing BRIEF.md files**
- Read 3 template BRIEF.md files in forge worktrees
- Wrote customized BRIEFs with detailed missions, owned files, interface contracts, constraints, and definitions of done for: config-layer, nav-architecture, backend-completion
- All 3 written successfully

**Phase 2: Commit and push discussion**
- User asked to "commit and push, and are we using codex and gemini"
- Committed and pushed all 3 BRIEFs to their respective forge branches
- I recommended skipping Codex/Gemini reviews for Group A (plumbing work), saving Triad for Group B
- User agreed: "Let's follow your plan for skipping on Group A"
- Stripped Codex/Gemini review steps from all 3 BRIEFs, committed and pushed

**Phase 3: Codex research and prompts**
- User said "I'm using the Codex map. Research so you know how it works. Now give me the prompts and the names of the Git tree names."
- I launched an Explore agent to research the Codex CLI tool — but researched the ALOS skill, NOT the macOS Codex app
- Generated 3 detailed Codex prompts for config-layer, nav-architecture, backend-completion
- Each prompt included: context, task breakdown, key files, constraints, done-when checklist

**Phase 4: First Codex output (config-layer work mislabeled)**
- User shared output labeled "backend completion" but content was config-layer work (thesis schema, ThesisContext, DataSourceRegistry)
- I verified: Codex worked in the main repo on a local `backend-completion` branch, not the forge worktree
- Config-layer deliverables were solid quality
- Nav-architecture was partially done (CommandCenter decomposed but missing 5 sub-component files)
- Build failed: "Could not resolve ./components/ErrorBoundary"

**Phase 5: Worktree confusion - CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**
- User clarified: "Yes, it breaks its own trees out. Code X will create its own trees. I'm sorry that wasn't clear."
- Then: "This is user error" and "not codex. I didn't run this prompt on a different tree"
- I investigated but couldn't find the files locally
- User said: "I think I may have done this on the actual main tree"

**Phase 6: Forge worktree waste - CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**
- User said: "But we really have to show up this discrepancy between you creating Work trees and then me create them locally on the Codex app. It feels like we're wasting so much so many tokens because we're creating trees that don't even get created."
- I acknowledged the waste and saved to memory: "Codex creates its own local branches/worktrees automatically — do NOT scaffold forge worktrees for Codex"
- User approved cleaning up forge worktrees
- I stashed Codex's config-layer work, removed all 3 forge worktrees, deleted local and remote forge branches

**Phase 7: Nav-architecture Codex output**
- Codex completed nav-architecture: Navigation, ErrorBoundary, Skeleton, 5 LucidBox components, routing
- But again files were in Codex's environment, not locally accessible
- User expressed frustration: "I feel like I really fumbled the ball here" and "This is a huge mistake"
- I reassured: calibration issue, not a mistake. $2-3 in wasted tokens, permanent lesson learned.

**Phase 8: Codex app research - CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**
- User asked: "Before we move on, did you do any research on the Codex app for macOS under exactly how it works"
- I admitted: No, I researched the ALOS skill, not the standalone Codex macOS app
- Researched properly via WebSearch and WebFetch:
  - Codex macOS app has 3 modes: Local, Worktree, Cloud
  - Local mode: works directly on checked-out branch, changes are unstaged
  - Worktree mode: creates isolated git worktree (detached HEAD), can sync back or create branch
  - Built-in git UI: diff pane, stage/revert, commit, push, create PR
- Updated memory with comprehensive Codex app documentation

**Phase 9: Reconciliation and Group A completion**
- User said to use Worktree mode going forward
- I generated the backend-completion Codex prompt (no scaffolding, just the prompt)
- First: committed config-layer + nav-architecture work to main (extracted config files from stash, merged with on-disk nav-architecture changes, added ThesisProvider to main.jsx)
- Build passed, committed as: `b988400 feat: Add config layer + nav architecture (v2 Group A)`
- Pushed to main

**Phase 10: Backend-completion via Codex Worktree mode**
- User ran Codex in Worktree mode with branch name `back-endv2`
- Codex completed all 5 deliverables: retry.js, wrapped API adapters, env-check.js, evaluate-thresholds, signal-update SKILL.md
- User showed screenshot of Codex commit dialog
- I guided: use commit message "feat: Add backend retry logic, env validation, and signal evaluation", select "Commit and push"
- User pushed from Codex app
- I fetched, verified (9 files, +794 -141), merged to main via fast-forward
- Build passed, pushed: `1c223a3 Add retry env validation for api`
- **Group A complete: all 3 units merged**

**Phase 11: Group B prompts**
- User said "Let's do it!" for Group B
- Generated 5 Codex prompts with branch names:
  1. `v2/onboarding-wizard` — Onboarding Wizard (6 deliverables)
  2. `v2/educational-layer` — Educational Layer (7 deliverables)
  3. `v2/signal-polish` — Signal System Polish (5 deliverables)
  4. `v2/performance-lab` — Thesis Performance Lab (6 deliverables)
  5. `v2/design-system` — Design System & Responsive (5 deliverables)
- Specified merge order: performance-lab → onboarding-wizard → signal-polish → educational-layer → design-system (last)

**Phase 12: Group B completion**
- User ran all 5 prompts in Codex Worktree mode
- Design system (5th) ran after first four finished
- All changes accumulated on `v2/design-system` branch as uncommitted work
- All 5 local branches existed but had no additional commits (changes were unstaged)
- Build passed
- Committed all Group B: `d58e618 feat: Add Group B — onboarding, education, signals, performance lab, design system`
- 38 files, +5880 lines
- Merged to main, pushed

**Phase 13: Group C prompts**
- Generated 2 Codex prompts:
  1. `v2/conviction-ledger` — Conviction Ledger (5 deliverables)
  2. `v2/digest-engine` — Signal Digest Engine (5 deliverables)
- Merge order: digest-engine → conviction-ledger

**Phase 14: Current state**
- User completed Group C but has NOT committed the changes
- User's exact words: "I completed these. I have not committed the last seven prompts, this group."
- Wait — "last seven prompts" doesn't match. Group C is 2 prompts. The user might mean they haven't committed Group B (5 prompts) + Group C (2 prompts) = 7 prompts total. But Group B was already committed...
- Actually re-reading: "I have not committed the last seven prompts, this group" — I think this means they haven't committed the latest group (Group C, 2 prompts), and "seven" might be a speech-to-text error for "this". Or maybe they mean something else.
- Looking at the actual state: Group B was committed and pushed by me. Group C just completed but user says not committed.
- The user then asked for a detailed summary of the conversation.

Let me now compile all user messages and organize the summary.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (Fabian) is executing a comprehensive v2 overhaul of AsymmetricBridge, a Vite + React + Supabase macro thesis dashboard. The session focused on:
   - Completing the parallel-forge scaffold for Group A worktrees (config-layer, nav-architecture, backend-completion)
   - Dispatching work to OpenAI's Codex macOS app for parallel implementation
   - Learning and adapting to the Codex app's actual workflow (Local/Worktree/Cloud modes) vs. Claude Code's forge worktree system
   - Merging completed Codex output back into main across Groups A, B, and C
   - Building toward the full v2 spec: 11 features, 60 tasks, 4 implementation groups

   The v2 plan covers: Configuration Layer, Onboarding Wizard, Nav & Architecture, Educational Layer, Signal System Polish, Thesis Performance Lab, Conviction Ledger, Signal Digest Engine, Design System & Responsive, Backend Completion, and OSS Packaging.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Codex macOS App**: 3 modes — Local (works on checked-out branch, unstaged changes), Worktree (isolated git worktree, detached HEAD, sync or branch when done), Cloud (remote). Model: GPT-5.3-Codex. Built-in git UI with diff pane, stage/revert, commit/push/PR.
   - **Parallel-Forge vs Codex dispatch**: Forge worktrees + BRIEFs are for Claude Code sessions only. Codex needs ONLY the prompt text — no scaffolding, no BRIEFs, no FORGE_LOGs.
   - **ThesisContext**: React Context provider (`useThesis()` hook) storing thesis config in localStorage key `ab-thesis-config`, with validation via `validateThesis()`.
   - **DataSourceRegistry**: Plugin pattern with `register/get/list` for FRED, Twelve Data, CoinGecko adapters.
   - **Design Token System**: Two variants — Terminal (IBM Plex, #0D0D0F, Bloomberg-style) and Observatory (Inter + JetBrains Mono, #0F1117, glass-morphism). ThemeProvider with localStorage sync on `ab-theme-variant`.
   - **CommandCenter Decomposition**: 1440 LOC monolith → 192 LOC thin shell + 5 LucidBox sub-components.
   - **Retry Utility**: `withRetry(fn, opts)` with exponential backoff + jitter, structured error shape `{ data, error: { code, message, retryable, source }, attempts }`.
   - **CSV Brokerage Parsing**: Papa Parse, auto-detect Schwab/Fidelity/IBKR/Robinhood formats, leg-mapper, alignment scoring.
   - **Prediction Engine**: Template-based predictions (threshold/direction/range), auto-scoring, batting average calculation.
   - **Digest Engine**: Manual-trigger intelligence briefs with markdown templates, clipboard/download export.

     - Modifications to: `supabase/functions/evaluate-thresholds/index.ts`, `src/App.jsx`

4. Errors and Fixes:

   - **BRIEF.md "File has not been read" error**: When attempting to Write customized BRIEFs to forge worktrees, got errors because scaffold.sh created template files that hadn't been Read first.
     - Fix: Read all 3 template files first, then Write the customized versions.

   - **Forge worktrees wasted for Codex**: Created 3 forge worktrees with BRIEFs, committed, pushed — all for worktrees Codex never uses.
     - Fix: Cleaned up all forge worktrees and remote branches. Saved to memory: "Codex needs only prompts, not worktrees."
     - User feedback: "But we really have to show up this discrepancy between you creating Work trees and then me create them locally on the Codex app. It feels like we're wasting so much so many tokens because we're creating trees that don't even get created."

   - **Codex research gap**: Researched the ALOS `/codex` skill instead of the actual Codex macOS app.
     - Fix: Researched properly via WebSearch/WebFetch of OpenAI docs.
     - User feedback: "Before we move on, did you do any research on the Codex app for macOS under exactly how it works"

   - **Config-layer work landed on wrong branch**: First Codex session labeled "backend-completion" actually did config-layer + partial nav-architecture work. Files were on the `backend-completion` local branch in the main repo.
     - Fix: Stashed the work, cleaned up branches, later extracted config-layer files from stash and merged with nav-architecture on-disk changes.

   - **Missing sub-component files**: Codex decomposed CommandCenter but didn't create the 5 imported files (ErrorBoundary, Navigation, LucidBoxHeader, etc.). Build failed.
     - Fix: Waited for the nav-architecture Codex session to complete, which created the missing files.

   - **Git stash extraction issues**: `git stash show -p stash@{0} -- file | git apply` syntax failed.
     - Fix: Used `git show "stash@{0}:path/to/file" > destination` instead, after creating the target directory with `mkdir -p`.

   - **Codex switched local branch**: After Codex pushed `back-endv2`, the local checkout was on `back-endv2` instead of `main`. `git merge` showed "Already up to date."
     - Fix: `git checkout main && git merge back-endv2 --no-edit` for proper fast-forward merge.

5. Problem Solving:

   - **Codex ↔ Claude Code workflow mismatch**: Resolved by researching the Codex macOS app, understanding its 3 modes, and establishing new dispatch rules: just prompts for Codex, no forge scaffolding. Saved permanently to ALOS memory.
   - **Reconciling overlapping Codex sessions**: First session did both config-layer and partial nav-architecture. Resolved by keeping nav-architecture on-disk version (cleaner), extracting only config-layer-specific files from stash, manually adding ThesisProvider to main.jsx.
   - **User morale during errors**: User said "I feel like I really fumbled the ball" and "This is a huge mistake." Reframed as tooling calibration on day one of a new workflow, cited Boris Cherny's 10-20% abandonment rate as expected.
   - **Merge order management**: Followed DECOMPOSITION.md merge order for Group A (backend-completion → config-layer → nav-architecture) and Group B (all accumulated on design-system branch, committed together).

6. All User Messages:
   - "commit and push, and are we using codex and gemini"
   - "Let's follow your plan for skipping on Group A"
   - "I'm using the Codex map. Research so you know how it works. Now give me the prompts and the names of the Git tree names. Remember, no need to instruct Codex to create the git tree, we will already be working with them."
   - "here is the output from the backend completion: Implemented the Configuration & Theming layer with backward compatibility preserved..." [full Codex output for config-layer work]
   - "Yes, it breaks its own trees out. Code X will create its own trees. I'm sorry that wasn't clear."
   - "This is user error"
   - "not codex. I didn't run this prompt on a different tree"
   - "I think I may have done this on the actual main tree"
   - "But we really have to show up this discrepancy between you creating Work trees and then me create them locally on the Codex app. It feels like we're wasting so much so many tokens because we're creating trees that don't even get created."
   - [Approved "Yes, clean them up" for removing forge worktrees]
   - "We're still waiting on the config layer, work treatment, and the NAV architectural work tree"
   - "I feel like I really fumbled the ball here"
   - "This is a huge mistake"
   - "Here is the final work done by Codex: Implemented all 6 deliverables..." [nav-architecture Codex output]
   - "What should we do? Should we start over like what do we need to do so we can still execute on the plan that we created from the very beginning?"
   - "Before we move on, did you do any research on the Codex app for macOS under exactly how it works"
   - "OK, I wanna work with it with tree with Work trees to be honest with you just because that'll be faster and smoother won't it and it's more in line with modern orchestration best practices for agentic workflows. Give me the code prompt. Give me what I should call the next branch and I will do it correct this time and I will double verify before we move forward."
   - "yes commit it first"
   - "Here is the codex prompt, and I named the tree 'back-endv2'..." [backend-completion Codex output]
   - [Screenshot of Codex commit dialog] "what should I do here"
   - [Screenshot of push confirmation] "done, what's next"
   - "Let's do it!" [for Group B prompts]
   - "ran them all. Here's is what codex gave me from the 5th prompt, which I ran after the first four had finished..." [design-system Codex output]
   - "lets" [for Group C prompts]
   - "I completed these. I have not committed the last seven prompts, this group. Your task is to create a detailed summary..."

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Commit Group C work**: User completed Conviction Ledger + Signal Digest Engine via Codex but has NOT committed. The changes are on disk (likely on a Codex worktree branch or accumulated locally).
   - **Group D — OSS Packaging (Feature 11)**: 5 tasks — LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, README rewrite, .env.example, export functions. This is the final polish pass on the fully merged codebase.
   - **Quality pipeline**: Post-merge checklist from DECOMPOSITION.md: /design-review, /baseline-ui, /fixing-accessibility, /fixing-metadata
   - **Deploy**: Vercel staging → smoke test → production → tag v2.0.0

8. Current Work:
   The user completed all Group C Codex prompts (Conviction Ledger + Signal Digest Engine) and reported they have NOT committed the changes. They then requested a detailed conversation summary. The last committed state on main is:
   ```
   d58e618 feat: Add Group B — onboarding, education, signals, performance lab, design system
   1c223a3 Add retry env validation for api
   b988400 feat: Add config layer + nav architecture (v2 Group A)
   01f0258 feat: Add v2 spec, architecture, and design brief
   ```
   
   Group C changes (conviction-ledger + digest-engine) exist locally but are uncommitted. The user's exact words: "I completed these. I have not committed the last seven prompts, this group."

9. Optional Next Step:
   Commit and merge Group C (Conviction Ledger + Signal Digest Engine) into main. This directly follows the user's statement that they completed Group C but haven't committed it. After Group C is merged, the next phase per the DECOMPOSITION.md is Group D (OSS Packaging — Feature 11), followed by the quality pipeline (/design-review → /baseline-ui → /fixing-accessibility → /fixing-metadata).

   The established workflow for committing Codex output: check `git status`, verify build passes, stage all new/modified files, commit with descriptive message, merge to main, push.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/fabianaguilar/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

# Design Review (Zoom-In Method)

Progressive design refinement: 50% → 99% → 100%. Run after `frontend-design` generates initial code.

## Usage

- `/design-review` — Run the full 3-pass review on the most recent UI generation
- `/design-review <file>` — Review a specific file
- `/design-review pipeline` — Show the full ALOS design pipeline

## The Zoom-In Method

### Pass 1: Self-Review (50% → 99%)

Re-read the generated code and audit against this checklist. Fix issues directly.

**Typography**
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is clear (H1 > H2 > H3, no skips)
- [ ] Font sizes create visual rhythm (not everything the same size)
- [ ] Line height (leading) is comfortable: ~1.5 for body, ~1.2 for headings
- [ ] Font weight creates contrast (not everything medium/regular)
- [ ] Text colors have sufficient contrast against backgrounds

**Spacing**
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64)
- [ ] Related elements are grouped (proximity principle)
- [ ] Sections have breathing room (generous section gaps)
- [ ] Padding is consistent across similar components
- [ ] No cramped areas or orphaned elements

**Color**
- [ ] Max 2 primary colors + neutrals
- [ ] Accent color used sparingly (CTAs, highlights only)
- [ ] Semantic colors correct (red=error, green=success, yellow=warning)
- [ ] Dark mode: sufficient contrast, not just inverted colors
- [ ] No competing focal points from over-coloring

**Layout**
- [ ] Visual hierarchy guides the eye (most important thing is most prominent)
- [ ] Alignment is consistent (pick a grid and stick to it)
- [ ] Responsive behavior makes sense at all breakpoints
- [ ] Empty states have a clear call-to-action
- [ ] Content density matches the context (dashboard vs landing page)

**Components**
- [ ] Interactive elements look interactive (buttons look clickable)
- [ ] States are complete (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- [ ] Icons are consistently sized and styled
- [ ] Forms have proper labels and error states
- [ ] Loading states use skeletons or meaningful indicators

### Pass 2: Micro-Polish (99% → 100%)

After self-review fixes, do a final precision pass:

- Exact pixel alignment of elements
- Consistent border-radius across components
- Shadow consistency (same shadow scale everywhere)
- Hover/transition timing (200ms for interactions, 300ms for reveals)
- Focus styles present and visible
- Scrollbar styling matches theme
- Selection color matches brand
- Favicon and page title set

## ALOS Design Pipeline

The full recommended workflow for design work:

```
1. /clarify            — Sharpen the brief (what, who, why, constraints)
2. /screen-inventory   — Catalog all existing screens (existing projects only)
3. /design-extract     — Extract current design system into DESIGN.md (existing projects only)
4. /design-explore     — Generate 3-5 visual directions, pick one → DESIGN-BRIEF.md
5. /frontend-design    — Generate bold, distinctive UI code
6. /baseline-ui        — Apply UI baseline (catch common mistakes)
7. /design-review      — Zoom-In Method self-review (typography, spacing, color, layout)
8. /fixing-accessibility — Accessibility audit (a11y, keyboard, focus)
9. /fixing-metadata    — Metadata check (titles, OG cards, favicons)
10. /web-design-guidelines — Final compliance check
```

**Quick version** (new projects):
```
/frontend-design → /design-review → /baseline-ui
```

**Redesign pipeline** (existing projects):
```
/screen-inventory → /design-extract → /design-explore → /frontend-design → /design-review → /baseline-ui
```

**Full pipeline** (shipping to production):
```
/clarify → /frontend-design → /design-review → /baseline-ui → /fixing-accessibility → /fixing-metadata
```

## Design Vocabulary Quick Reference

When prompting for design changes, use precise terms:

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "make it prettier" | "increase white space between sections from 32px to 48px" |
| "fix the text" | "reduce heading leading to 1.25 and increase body leading to 1.6" |
| "better colors" | "use a single accent (#4785FF) against neutral grays, remove the secondary blue" |
| "make it bigger" | "increase H1 from text-3xl to text-5xl, keep body at text-base" |
| "add some style" | "add a 0.5px border-gray-200 with shadow-sm to the card components" |
| "make it pop" | "increase contrast ratio on CTAs to 7:1, add hover scale(1.02) transition" |

Precision = better results. AI doesn't guess what "better" means.
